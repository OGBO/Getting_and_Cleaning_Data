## Getting and Cleaning Data
# Synopsis
The project involves a series of tasks relating to the gathering and manipulation of data resulting in a clean and tidy set of data set that may be consumed by various individuals
The course work is based on an initial set of data that may downloaded from the below URL:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

# Initial Requirements and Adjustments
The working directory on my local machine was set to the “UCI HAR Dataset” directory i.e. the name of the directory that the files were unzipped to.
Therefore the path will therefore need to be expressly defined in order to reflect an appropriate working directory that contains the unzipped files.
# Course work tasks
Specific instructions were given to carry out the following tasks.
1. Submission of a tidy data set.
2. Create a link to a Github repository which contains the course work
3. A Code Book that describes the variables, data, transformations employed
4. A README.md file explaining workings and connectivity of the scripts
